  "description": "👋 Hi, I’m @cyppherr, your friendly neighborhood code wizard. 👀 I’m interested in bending the rules of reality with my keyboard strokes. 🌱 I’m currently learning the mystical arts of the MERN stack – because why settle for just one when you can conquer them all? 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that'll make Elon Musk raise an eyebrow and say, \"Okay, now that's pretty cool.\" 📫 How to reach me? Easy-peasy lemon squeezy, just shoot me an email at madaan.piyush01@gmail.com, and let's make some coding magic happen. 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His (or you can just call me \"Your Majesty of Code\" if you're feeling fancy). ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the shortest war in history lasted only 38 minutes? Yeah, apparently, it was between Zanzibar and England. I guess someone forgot to bring their army that day!",
