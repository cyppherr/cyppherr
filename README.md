👋 Hi, I’m @cyppherr, your friendly neighborhood code wizard.
👀 I’m interested in bending the rules of reality with my keyboard strokes.
🌱 I’m currently learning the mystical arts of the MERN stack – because why settle for just one when you can conquer them all?
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that'll make Elon Musk raise an eyebrow and say, "Okay, now that's pretty cool."
📫 How to reach me? Easy-peasy lemon squeezy, just shoot me an email at madaan.piyush01@gmail.com, and let's make some coding magic happen.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His (or you can just call me "Your Majesty of Code" if you're feeling fancy).
⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the shortest war in history lasted only 38 minutes? Yeah, apparently, it was between Zanzibar and England. I guess someone forgot to bring their army that day!
